    "text-faq1-q": "Why is a professional website important for my local business?",
    "text-faq1-a": "A professional website acts as your digital storefront, open 24/7. It builds trust with customers, showcases your services, and makes it easy for them to contact you, leading directly to more business.",
    "text-faq2-q": "How long does it take to get my website online?",
    "text-faq2-a": "We prioritize speed. Typically, a complete one-page website is live and ready to attract customers within 7 to 14 days after we receive your business information and content.",
    "text-faq3-q": "Will my website work on mobile phones?",
    "text-faq3-a": "Absolutely. Every website we build is fully responsive, meaning it will look great and function perfectly on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.",
    "text-faq4-q": "What is a Google Business Profile and why do I need it?",
    "text-faq4-a": "It is the most powerful free tool for local businesses. It allows you to appear on Google Maps and in local search results. A well-optimized profile brings customers directly to your door.",
    "text-faq5-q": "I am not a technical person. Is this process complicated?",
    "text-faq5-a": "Not at all. We handle everything for you. Our process is designed to be simple: we discuss your needs, you provide the business details, and we build your complete online presence.",
    "text-faq6-q": "Can you create the website in multiple languages?",
    "text-faq6-a": "Yes, this is one of our specialties. We can build your website in Dutch, French, German, and English to ensure you can serve every customer in your area.",
    "text-faq7-q": "Are there any hidden monthly fees for the website?",
    "text-faq7-a": "The website design is a one-time payment. The only other costs are for your domain name (e.g., www.mybusiness.be) and hosting, which are small annual fees paid to a third party. We help you set this up transparently.",
    "text-faq8-q": "I already have a logo. Can you use it?",
    "text-faq8-a": "Of course. We will build your website’s design and branding around your existing logo to ensure brand consistency.",
